# Mouse-Pharmaceutical-Analysis

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of several potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma.  Out of the 10 treatments tested, two showed the most potential - Capumolin and Ramicane.  Mice treated with these two drugs had significanly lower tumor volumes at the end of the experiment compared to mice treated with other drugs. Capomulin also appeared to cause a reduction in tumor volume over the course of 45 days.  

Other than Capumolin and Ramicane, no other drugs appeared to have a significant effect on tumor volume.  When the mean tumor volumes for each drug regimen were compared, most drugs had similar values to the placebo.
